# digitalEqualizer

Here you can find the implementation of a digital equalizer in Python. The file "equalizador.py" contains the calculations used for the filters. The files "eq_tela.py" and "eq_tela_color.py" are used to create the graphical interface where the user will load their audio file in .wav format, configure the desired equalization and name the generated audio file.

A brief report on the project development can be found in "Equalizador_Digital.pdf" in Portuguese.

A video showing the results can be accessed in https://youtu.be/Tk8XW0tELiY
